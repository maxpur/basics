# basics
A collection of entry level C++ projects which serve other students to discover new programming approaches as well as new knowledge about algorithm and datastructure implementation.

## Projects

1. [Sudoku solver 9x9](https://github.com/maxpur/basics/tree/master/Sudoku%20solver)
- This soduko solver uses a simple brute force approach to solve every 9x9 soduko you can imagine.
- Details of its implementation can be found in the corresponding directory `Sudoku_Solver`

## Usage
Every project comes with an [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)). You can use it to compile the project instead of doing it manually.
In case you use the Makefile please make sure you have installed a C++ compiler g++ as well as Make. Afterwards you can use the following commands to execute the code (in case of an unix system):<br/>
1. `make` <br/>
2. `./<name of the directory> (whitespace is replaced by underscore)`<br/>

If you want to delete every .o file that will be created during the compiling process you can run:<br/>
`make clean`
