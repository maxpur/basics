# basics
A collection of entry level C++ projects which serve other students to discover new programming approaches as well as new knowledge about algorithm and datastructure implementation.

## Projects

1. [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/maxpur/basics/tree/master/Sudoku%20solver)
- This soduko solver uses a simple brute force approach to solve every soduko you can imagine.
- Details of its implementation can be found in the corresponding directory `Sudoku_Solver`
- Not finished yet

### Usage
Every project comes with an [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)). You can use it to compile the project instead of doing it manually.
Please make sure you have installed a C++ compiler like g++ as well as Make. Afterwards you can use the following commands to execute the code (in case of an unix system):<br/>
1. `make <name of the directory>`<br/>
2. `./<name of the directory>.exe`<br/>
